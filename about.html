<b>Media</b> <br>

New Release Today (03/11/2016):  "He's worked with mainstream artist Kid Cudi, had his music propel brands like Monster Energy, and Lebron James, and has had more than a million streams of his music heard online. But you probably haven't heard of N.Y.’s Queens K. Sparks--just the way he wants it."
<br><br>
<b>Dawn Annerson, digital publication No Depression</b> (02/15/2016): "KSparks is a distinct voice, and Hip Hop could always use distinction. The Queens NY native comes from the same environment as 50 Cent, and The Lost Boyz but judging by his content there’s little-to-no link to his hometown’s gangster content in his music. Instead, Sparks is a lyricist that tells stories almost reminiscent of Slick Rick, all the while adapting flows to fit each song with double entendres."
<br><br>
<b>Respect Magazine</b> (07/15/2020): "From Hip Hop Musician, Ghost Writer, and CEO, K. Sparks Successful Journey Will Push You To Give Your Best."
<br><br>
<b>Magnetic Magazine</b> (04/15/2020): "RhythmCouture is a company that looks to make those connections, specializing in music production for ads, television, and film. They boast a diverse roster of producers, composers, singers and rappers with placements in The New York Times, Netflix, Calvin Klein, VANS, Forever 21, Les Mills and elsewhere. We decided to chat with Rhythm Couture CEO Kyle Hunter for a new Industry Insider feature and go into the importance of insurance, how to best get a sync and more."
<br><br>
<b>Mark Ryan, digital publication New Release Tuesday</b> (02/18/2016): "K. Sparks album 'Seasons Theme' is the closest thing to a concept piece I've ever heard. As it moves through spring, summer, fall and winter, your ears are treated to a variety of sights and sounds, the same variety and changing landscapes that one would experience in a full year. There is an impressive amount of cleverly used samples, old school turntablism and a variety of jazz styles on display. The beats groove and the lyrics flow with ease."
